== Inter-Satellite Sync network sync

Inter-Satellite Sync (ISS) network sync enables a downstream satellite
server to synchronize data from an upstream satellite server instead of
the Red Hat content delivery network (CDN). The benefit of this feature
is simplifying environments where network separation is required to
segregate infrastructure from direct connections to the internet. ISS
network sync is useful where DMZ topologies are required.

ISS network sync configuration consists of the following.

. An upstream
satellite server (`+satellite.lab+`) synchronizing software from the Red
Hat CDN.
. A downstream satellite server (`+satellite-2.lab+`) configured to
synchronize software from `+satellite.lab+`.

The downstream satellite server must contain a manifest with valid Red
Hat subscriptions.

== Import the ssl certificate from satellite.lab

In order to secure the synchronization process between upstream and
downstream satellite servers, we need to import the upstream
(`+satellite.lab+`) SSL certificate into the downstream satellite server
(`+satellite-2.lab+`).

=====

[%collapsible]
====

Enter the following command in `satellite-2.lab terminal`.

[source,bash,run]
----
wget -P ~ http://satellite.lab/pub/katello-server-ca.crt
----

This command will download the `+katello-server-ca.crt+` from
`+satellite.lab+` to `+satellite-2.lab+`.

Next, in the `satellite-2.lab terminal`,
use the following command to import the certificate.

[source,bash,run]
----
hammer content-credential create \
--content-type cert \
--name "satellite.lab" \
--organization "Acme Org" \
--path ~/katello-server-ca.crt

== Configure the downstream satellite server to use the upstream satellite server as a CDN

Now we'll configure the downstream satellite server `satellite-2.lab` to use the upstream satellite server, `satellite.lab` as a content delivery network (CDN).

repository.

It is possible to select this repository because it has been provided by
the upstream satellite server `+satellite.lab+`.

If we select another repository that hasnâ€™t been synchronized to the
upstream satellite server, a message would display
`+No repositories available+`.

.No repositories available

NOTE: You can skip to the next assignment without waiting for the
synchronization to complete.

Deregister rhel1.lab from satellite.lab and register it to
satellite-2.lab and install software.
