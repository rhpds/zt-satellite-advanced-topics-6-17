== Remote Execution (REX) Pull Mode

Since Satellite 6.12, Remote Execution or REX has provided the option of
a "`pull mode`". Remote execution pull mode uses Message Queuing
Telemetry Transport (MQTT) to publish jobs on Capsule servers (or
Capsule service running on a Satellite server). Managed hosts subscribe
to the MQTT broker to receive REX job notifications.

REX pull mode is useful for organizations that wish to reduce the amount
of incoming traffic permitted for Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts. Rather
than allowing remote execution operations through SSH, REX pull mode
listens for messages from the Satellite server to download and run
remote execution operations.

Here’s how REX Pull mode works:

[arabic]
. A managed host receives MQTT notification that there is a new REX job.
. The managed host downloads the job "`payload`" via HTTPS from the
Capsule service (in this lab the capsule service is running on the
Satellite server itself).
. The job "`payload`" is run on the host. As the job executes, the
progress of the job is reported back to the Capsule service.

Here are the configuration considerations:

[arabic]
. Port 1883 (MQTT) must be opened on the Satellite server running the
Capsule service to allow incoming requests to subscribe to REX pull
notifications, and the host must be allowed to connect to the Capsule
server on port 443 (HTTPS) to enable REX pull mode.
. Capsule servers (and Capsule services) must be configured to support
either REX SSH mode or REX pull mode. You cannot configure a Capsule to
support both REX modes.
. For existing hosts running the katello agent, you can migrate to REX
pull mode by installing the katello-pull-transport-migrate package.
Documentation is provided at the bottom of this post. The katello agent
has been deprecated as of Satellite 6.7.

Katello Agent is removed from Satellite 6.17.

== Register the host rhel1 to the Satellite server

We’ll register the host `+rhel1+` to our Satellite server using the
command line interface to generate a registration command in this lab.
The host `+rhel1+` will be configured to use REX in SSH mode, giving us
the opportunity to migrate it to pull mode.

It is also possible to generate a registration command from the
Satellite WebUI but due to the limitations of DNS in this lab
environment, we’ll use the cli utility `+hammer+` to simplify the
process.

Click on `satellite.lab terminal`.

.satellite server tab
image::satellite.lab-terminal.png[satellite server tab]

Run the following command.

[source,bash,run]
----
export regscript=$(hammer host-registration generate-command --activation-key RHEL9 --setup-insights 0 --insecure 1 --force 1)
ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" root@rhel1 $regscript
----

In order to save time, the command used above creates a global
registration script that uses the RHEL9 activation key and runs it via
SSH on `+rhel1+`.

== Enable pull mode on the Satellite server

Copy and paste the following to the `satellite.lab terminal` and run the command.

[source,bash,run]
----
satellite-installer --foreman-proxy-plugin-remote-execution-script-mode pull-mqtt
----

== Open required firewall ports on the Satellite server

Open the required firewall ports with the following command.

[source,bash,run]
----
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port="1883/tcp" && firewall-cmd --reload
----

NOTE: There is currently no support for changing this port to a
different port number.

Port 1883 is required to be open on the Satellite server to enable hosts
to subscribe to updates. That is, the RHEL hosts need to be able to tell
the Satellite server that they are listening for messages that REX jobs
are available to be run.

Upon notification that a REX job is available, the RHEL host downloads
the REX job from the Satellite server via HTTPS (port 443).

== Configure jobs to be sent through the capsule service that the host was registered to

The following setting enables hosts to receive REX jobs through the
satellite or capsule server they were registered through. If this
setting is not made, REX jobs would be dispatched through a satellite or
capsule server depending on the following
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_satellite/6.16/html/managing_hosts/configuring_and_setting_up_remote_jobs_managing-hosts#remote-execution-workflow_managing-hosts[rules
in this document].

Copy and run the following script.

[source,bash,run]
----
tee ~/rexsetting.yml << EOF
---
- name: Configure Satellite 6.17
  hosts: localhost
  remote_user: root

  tasks:
  - name: "Set REX preferred through registered server."
    redhat.satellite.setting:
      username: "admin"
      password: "bc31c9a6-9ff0-11ec-9587-00155d1b0702"
      server_url: "https://satellite.lab"
      name: "remote_execution_prefer_registered_through_proxy"
      value: "true"
EOF
----

Run the playbook.

[source,bash,run]
----
ansible-playbook rexsetting.yml
----

== Migrate the rhel1 host to REX pull mode

At the beginning of this assignment, we registered the host `+rhel1+` to
use REX in "`push`" or SSH mode. We’ll now migrate it to "`pull`" mode.

Click this button link:tab-2[button label="`rhel1`"
background="`#ee0000`" color="`#c7c7c7`"] to switch to the `+rhel1+` tab
and install `+katello-pull-transport-migrate+` by running the following
command.

[source,bash,run]
----
dnf install katello-pull-transport-migrate -y
----

____
[!NOTE] The `+katello-pull-transport-migrate+` package is provided by
the `+satellite-client-6-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms+` repository. This repo
was added to the satellite server and enabled by the activation key in
the second task of this lab.
____

Check that the MQTT agent `+yggdrasild+` is running.

[source,bash,run]
----
systemctl status yggdrasild
----

The output should look like the screenshot below.

.yggdrasild service
image::../assets/yggdrasildservicestatus.png[yggdrasild service]

== Test out REX pull mode

Now we’ll run a test to confirm that REX pull mode is working. On
link:tab-2[button label="`rhel1`" background="`#ee0000`"
color="`#c7c7c7`"], run the following command to tail the `+messages+`
log file.

[source,bash,run]
----
tail -f /var/log/messages
----

Now go into the Satellite Web UI and navigate to `+All hosts+`.

.all hosts
image::../assets/allhosts.png[all hosts]

Click the checkbox for `+rhel1+`.

.rhel1
image::../assets/selectrhel1.png[rhel1]

Schedule a remote job for `+rhel1+`.

.schedule
image::../assets/schedulerhel1.png[schedule]

In the `+Category and template menu+`, don’t change any parameters and
click next.

.cat
image::../assets/categoryandtemplate.png[cat]

In the `+Target hosts and inputs menu+` do the following:

[arabic]
. Enter `+uname -a+` in the `+command+` box.
. Click `+Run on selected hosts+`.

.target
image::../assets/targethostsandinputs.png[target]

The REX pull mode job will execute. Once the `+Results+` menu shows
100%, click on the `+rhel1+` tab.

The `+messages+` log file should display something similar to this.

.ygg successful
image::../assets/successfulyggdrasild.png[ygg successful]

== Configure Satellite to automatically configure REX pull mode when registering new hosts

At present, Satellite will register hosts in REX SSH mode by default.
We’ll need to set a new Global Parameter to enable pull mode by default,
with a global parameter. In the link:tab-0[button label="`Satellite
Server`" background="`#ee0000`" color="`#c7c7c7`"] terminal, enter the
following command.

[source,bash,run]
----
tee ~/rexdefault.yml << EOF
---
- name: Configure Satellite 6.17
  hosts: localhost
  remote_user: root

  tasks:
  - name: "Set global parameter to default REX pull mode."
    redhat.satellite.global_parameter:
      username: "admin"
      password: "bc31c9a6-9ff0-11ec-9587-00155d1b0702"
      server_url: "https://satellite.lab"
      name: "host_registration_remote_execution_pull"
      value: "true"
      parameter_type: boolean
      state: present
EOF
----

Run the playbook in the link:tab-0[button label="`Satellite Server`"
background="`#ee0000`" color="`#c7c7c7`"] terminal.

[source,bash,run]
----
ansible-playbook rexdefault.yml
----

This playbook creates a global parameter
`+host_registration_remote_execution_pull+` with the value of `+true+`.

You can check to see this parameter was successfully created by
navigating to the `+Global Parameters+` menu.

.global params
image::../assets/globalparameters.png[global params]

You can see the newly created global parameter is set.

.global param set
image::../assets/rexpulltrue.png[global param set]

== Register rhel1 to verify automatic configuration of REX pull mode

Let’s unregister `+rhel1+` from our Satellite server. After that we’ll
register `+rhel1+` again to show that REX pull mode is automatically
enabled.

In the link:tab-0[button label="`Satellite Server`"
background="`#ee0000`" color="`#c7c7c7`"] terminal run the following
command.

[source,bash,run]
----
ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" rhel1 "subscription-manager unregister" && ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" rhel1 "dnf remove -y katello-pull-transport-migrate"
----

This command is run to remove `+rhel1+` from the satellite server so
that we can register it again to show REX pull mode is automatically
enabled.

From the Satellite server, we’ll register `+rhel1+` to Satellite again.

[source,bash,run]
----
export regscript=$(hammer host-registration generate-command --activation-key RHEL9 --setup-insights 0 --insecure 1 --force 1)
ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" rhel1 $regscript
----

Here’s what the registration operation output looks like for `+rhel1+`.

.rex pull
image::../assets/rexpullrhel1auto.png[rex pull]

Notice the installation of `+yggdrasild+` components.

You can check to see if REX pull mode was successfully configured
onlink:tab-2[button label="`rhel1`" background="`#ee0000`"
color="`#c7c7c7`"] by checking the yggdrasild demon is running.

[source,bash,run]
----
systemctl status yggdrasild
----

== Force a single errata to be detected on rhel1

In this step, we’ll downgrade `+vim+` in to compel Satellite to detect
that at least one errata is installable on `+rhel1+`. This prepares
`+rhel1+` for the next step where we will install errata with REX pull
mode.

Run the following command in the link:tab-2[button label="`rhel1`"
background="`#ee0000`" color="`#c7c7c7`"] tab.

[source,bash,run]
----
dnf downgrade -y vim
----

== Apply installable errata to rhel1 using REX pull mode

Navigate to the `+Errata+` menu.

.errata
image::../assets/erratamenubar.png[errata]

Filter for the installable errata.

.filter
image::../assets/installable.png[filter]

Select the installable errata.

.installable
image::../assets/selectallerrata.png[installable]

Click `+Apply errata+`.

.apply
image::../assets/applyerrata.png[apply]

In the `+Apply errata+` wizard, do the following.

[arabic]
. Select `+rhel1+`.
. Click `+Next+`.

.apply
image::../assets/applyerratawizard.png[apply]

Click `+Confirm+`.

Click confirm to apply the errata.

To view the application of Errata in real-time, click on the host
`+rhel1+`.
