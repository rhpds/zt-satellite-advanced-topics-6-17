Inter-Satellite Sync (ISS) network sync enables a downstream satellite
server to synchronize data from an upstream satellite server instead of
the Red Hat content delivery network (CDN). The benefit of this feature
is simplifying environments where network separation is required to
segregate infrastructure from direct connections to the internet. ISS
network sync is useful where DMZ topologies are required.

ISS network sync configuration consists of the following. 1) An upstream
satellite server (`+satellite.lab+`) synchronizing software from the Red
Hat CDN.

[arabic, start=2]
. A downstream satellite server (`+satellite-2.lab+`) configured to
synchronize software from `+satellite.lab+`.

The downstream satellite server must contain a manifest with valid Red
Hat subscriptions.

== Import the ssl certificate from satellite.lab

In order to secure the synchronization process between upstream and
downstream satellite servers, we need to import the upstream
(`+satellite.lab+`) SSL certificate into the downstream satellite server
(`+satellite-2.lab+`).

Enter the following command into the link:tab-2[button label="`Satellite
Server 2`"] terminal.

[source,bash,run]
----
wget -P ~ http://satellite.lab/pub/katello-server-ca.crt
----

This command will download the `+katello-server-ca.crt+` from
`+satellite.lab+` to `+satellite-2.lab+`.

Next, in the link:tab-2[button label="`Satellite Server 2`"] terminal,
use the following command to import the certificate.

[source,bash,run]
----
hammer content-credential create \
--content-type cert \
--name "satellite.lab" \
--organization "Acme Org" \
--path ~/katello-server-ca.crt
----

== Configure the downstream satellite server to use the upstream satellite server as a CDN

In the `+Satellite Server 2 Web UI+`, log in with the following
credentials.

== Verify that satellite-2.lab can synchronize software from satellite.lab

Navigate to the `+Red Hat Repositories+` menu.

Click on the `+Recommended Repositories+` slider to change it to `+ON+`.

Select the `+Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 for x86_64 - BaseOS RPMs 9+`
repository.

image:../assets/selectRHEL10baseos.gif[../assets/selectRHEL10baseos]

It is possible to select this repository because it has been provided by
the upstream satellite server `+satellite.lab+`.

If we select another repository that hasnâ€™t been synchronized to the
upstream satellite server, a message would display
`+No repositories available+`.

== Optional self-directed exercise for the reader

Deregister rhel1.lab from satellite.lab and register it to
satellite-2.lab and install software.
