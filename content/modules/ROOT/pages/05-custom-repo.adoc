In this assignment we’ll upload software into a custom repository in
Satellite. This process involves creating the following:

[arabic]
. Create a product.
. Add a yum repository.
. Upload software to the repository.

A yum package called `+hello-0.0.1-1.el9.noarch.rpm+` has been
downloaded to `+/root/+` in `+satellite.lab+`. We will upload this
single package to the new repository.

== Create a custom product, repository, and upload a file

Add the following playbook to the `+Satellite Server+` by first clicking
on this button link:tab-0[button label="`Satellite Server`"
background="`#ee0000`" color="`#c7c7c7`"]. Then click on `+run+` below.

This playbook dows the following:

[arabic]
. Create a product called `+My custom product+`.
. Create a repository called `+My custom repository+`.
. Upload a file from `+/root/hello-0.0.1-1.el9.noarch.rpm+` to
`+My custom repository+`.

Run the playbook.

== Update the RHEL10 content view and publish and promote it

In order to make the `+hello+` rpm available to `+rhel+`, we must add
the repo to the `+RHEL10+` content view. You may recall in the previous
assignment, we had to create the `+RHEL10+` content view, containing the
RHEL10 BaseOS repo and publish it. Then we had to promote the `+RHEL10+`
content view to the `+Capsule Production+` lifecycle environment.
Finally we manually synchronized the `+Capsule Production+` lifecycle
environment to `+capsule.lab+`.

To replicate the custom repository we just created in this assignment,
we’ll need to update the `+RHEL10+` content view to add
`+My custom repository+` and publish it. Then we’ll promote the new
version of the `+RHEL10+` content view to the `+Capsule Production+`
lifecycle environment which will automatically synchronize to
`+capsule.lab+`.

Add the following playbook to the `+Satellite Server+` by first clicking
on this button link:tab-0[button label="`Satellite Server`"
