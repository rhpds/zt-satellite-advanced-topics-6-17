== Configure Satellite with the Satellite Ansible Collection.

In this assignment, weâ€™ll create an ansible playbook to automatically
configure the Satellite server. Red Hat provides an Ansible collection
to manage Red Hat Satellite configuration. Ansible playbooks are useful
for building disaster recovery instances of Satellite, or any other task
that requires a second Satellite server, including testing, and
upgrades.

Documentation for the Satellite Ansible collection can be found
https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/repo/published/redhat/satellite/docs[here]
(Red Hat account required).

== Install the Satellite Ansible collection - FOR DOCUMENTATION PURPOSES ONLY

WARNING: To reduce the amount of time waiting for for satellite
operations to complete, the Satellite Ansible Collection has been
preinstalled. Please read over this section and go to the next step.

== Create a playbook to configure the Satellite server

The playbook below is simply an example.

Next, run the script below to write the following ansible playbook.

[source,bash,run]
----
tee ~/config.yml << EOF
---
- name: Configure Satellite 6.17
  hosts: localhost
  remote_user: root

  tasks:
  - name: "Create an activation key."
    redhat.satellite.activation_key:
      username: "admin"
      password: "bc31c9a6-9ff0-11ec-9587-00155d1b0702"
      server_url: "https://satellite.lab"
      name: "RHEL10"
      content_view: "Default Organization View"
      organization: "Acme Org"
      lifecycle_environment: "Library"
      content_overrides:
          - label: satellite-client-6-for-rhel-10-x86_64-rpms
            override: enabled
EOF
----

This playbook creates an `+activation key+` which is used to control
access to repositories on Satellite. In this particular
`+activation key+`, the Satellite 6 client repository is overridden to
enabled.

The RHEL 10 BaseOS and AppStream, and Satellite Client repos have already
been synchronized and enabled to save time. These repos are available
through the default `+Library+` lifecycle environment.
