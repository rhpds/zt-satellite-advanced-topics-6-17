== Inter-Satellite Sync export sync

Inter-Satellite Sync (ISS) export sync exports software at the
repository, content view, and lifecycle environment levels. In this
assignment, we’ll export the custom repo '`My custom repository`' at the
content view level from `+satellite.lab+` and import it into
`+satellite-2.lab+`.

== Create a new content view

In order to save time, we’ll create a new content view with a minimal
amount of software.

This playbook creates a new content view called `+ISS export+`
containing the repository `+My custom repository+`. Then the playbook
publishes and promotes the content view `+ISS Export+` to the
`+Library+` lifecycle environment.

Execute the playbook in `satellite.lab terminal`

.SCP the data
image::mvexportstosatellite2.png[../assets/mvexportstosatellite2]

This command will create a new directory on `+satellite-2.lab+` in
`+/var/lib/pulp/imports+` called `+Acme_Org+` and copy all the exported
data to it.
