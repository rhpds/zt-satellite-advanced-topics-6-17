== Image Mode

Image mode is a new approach to operating system (OS) deployment that
lets users build, deploy, and manage Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a bootc
container image.

It reduces complexity across the enterprise by letting development,
operations, and solution providers use the same container-native tools
and techniques to manage everything from applications to the underlying
OS.

Red Hat Satellite 6.17 supports the management of RHEL image mode
systems. In this assignment, we’ll walk through the steps of registering
and updating an image mode system.

== Create a container repository in Satellite

The first step is to create a container repository in Satellite that will provide a method for storing image mode images.

this link.

.Booted container images
image::bootedcontainerimagehosts.png[../assets/bootedcontainerimagehosts]

Next do the following.

. Check the box to the left of the Power button.
. Select "`Schedule Remote Job`".

.Schedule remote job
image::runremotejobrhel2.png[../assets/runremotejobrhel2]

Next we’ll create a job to check bootc status.

. Select the "`Bootc`" job category.
. Select "`Bootc Status - Script Default`".
. Click "`Run on selected hosts`".

.Run job wizard
image::bootcstatusjob.png[../assets/bootcstatusjob]

Click on the "`rhel2.lab`" link.

Click on "`rhel2.lab`" to get to the host menu.

.Click rhel2.lab
image::getbacktorhel2.png[../assets/getbacktorhel2]

Click on the details tab.

.Details tab
image::detailstab.png[../assets/detailstab]

Scroll down to the "`Image mode details`" card.

.Image mode details card
image::runningimagehostsmenu.png[../assets/runningimagehostsmenu]

Here you can also see the "`Running image`" details which we will need
to use in the next step. This information is populated only after the
bootc status job is run or approximately every 4 hours.
====
=====

== Update the container image

The container image running on `+rhel2+` is stored in a quay.io
registry. We want to modify that image. We’ll use the host `+rhel1+` to
pull down that container image from quay.io and update it.

=====
.Update the container image
[%collapsible]
====
Navigate to the `rhel1.lab terminal`.

Copy and run the script below.

[source,bash,run]
----
cat <<EOT > Containerfile
FROM quay.io/toharris/rhel-bootc:summit-2025
RUN echo “Welcome to Summit 2025” > /etc/motd
EOT
----

This modification will create a new message-of-the-day "`Welcome to
Summit 2025`" and will be displayed upon login.

Next, let’s build the container from the ContainerFile with the command
below.

[source,bash,run]
----
podman build -f Containerfile -t satellite.lab/acme_org/bootc/rhel10beta:summit-2025
----

The command we just ran, applies the tag
`+satellite.lab/acme_org/bootc/rhel10beta:summit-2025+` to our newly
built container. The tag is the name assigned to the container image in
the Satellite container registry.
====
=====

== Push the new container to Satellite’s container registry

Now we’ll push the updated container image from `rhel1.lab terminal` to the
Satellite container registry.

=====
.Push container to Satellite's container registry
[%collapsible]
====
In the `rhel1.lab terminal`, log into Satellite container registry by
running the following command.

----
podman login --tls-verify=false satellite.lab --username admin --password bc31c9a6-9ff0-11ec-9587-00155d1b0702
----

From `+rhel1+` we’ll push our updated container image to Satellite.

[source,bash,run]
----
podman push satellite.lab/acme_org/bootc/rhel10beta:summit-2025 --tls-verify=false

image::successjobcompleteimagemodeswitch.png[../assets/successjobcompleteimagemodeswitch]


Click on the `rhel2.lab terminal`.

.rhel2.lab terminal
image::rhel2.lab-terminal.png[]

In this terminal, run the following command to check the status of our image mode host.

[source,bash,run]
----
bootc status
----

This shows that we have a staged container image with the label
`+satellite.lab/acme_org/bootc/rhel10beta:summit-2025+`. However, the
image mode host `+rhel2+`, is still booted with the old image with the
label `+quay.io/toharris/rhel-bootc:summit-2025+`.

.bootc status
image::bootcstatuscli.png[../assets/bootcstatuscli]

Enter the following to reboot into the new container image.

[source,bash,run]
----
reboot
----

Wait for the `rhel2.lab` system to come back online. You may need to click the `reconnect` button a couple times.

If the terminal looks like it is stuck trying to connect, click on the refresh button:

.Refresh button
image::rhel2-refresh-button.png[]

The terminal will reconnect and display the new message-of-the-day (MOTD).

.Login with new MOTD
image::rhel2.lab-login-new-motd.png[motd]

Notice that the message-of-the-day now displays
`+Welcome to Summit 2025+`.

And now check the bootc status by running this command in `rhel2.lab terminal`.

[source,bash,run]
----
bootc status
----

.bootc status
image::updatedbootcstatus.png[../assets/updatedbootcstatus]

You can now see that the image mode host `+rhel2+` is now running our
updated image labelled
`+satellite.lab/acme_org/bootc/rhel10beta:summit-2025+` and you’ll also
see that you can roll back to the previous image if required.
